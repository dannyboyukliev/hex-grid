    <string name="welcome">• The demo comprises a tabbed layout with two pages, Layout and Grid. The Layout page shows grids with children, in both Views and Compose. The Grid page demonstrates all of the available options and interaction modes for both types, along with a Drawable version that\'s also included in the library.\n\n• The View and Compose grids on both pages are clickable to toggle cells\' selected states.\n\n• On the Grid page, changing any of the first four properties – row count, column count, inset lines, and edge lines – will clear the selected states.\n\n• When designing the app\'s UI, only a few large phone screens were targeted and tested. I can\'t really guarantee that it\'ll look that great on any other setups. Just FYI.</string>
